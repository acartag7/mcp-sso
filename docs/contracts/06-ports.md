# 6. Ports

DDD-lite: pure core (use-cases + ports, no infra imports) and adapters at the
edge. Every external capability is a port so the core is testable in isolation.

## 6.1 `ClockPort`
```ts
interface ClockPort { nowMs(): number; }
```
Core use-cases never call ambient wall-clock APIs; tests and audit provenance need
deterministic time. Reference: `SystemClock` (wraps `Date.now()`).

## 6.2 `AuditPort`
```ts
interface AuditPort { writeAuthEvent(event: AuthAuditEvent): Promise<void>; }
```
Append-only, metadata-only (see §13). `noopAudit` is the test/local default.
v0.2 ships three reference sinks (§17.7, exported from the main entry — no
subpath/peer dep): `JsonlFileAudit(filePath)`, `WebhookAudit(url, opts)`, and
`combineAudit(...sinks)`. All three are **fail-open**: `writeAuthEvent` never
rejects, so an audit-write failure never blocks the auth operation (the use-cases
`await` it with no try/catch). Tool-call auditing is the host app's concern, not
this library's.

## 6.3 `StorePort` (the conformance boundary — see §12)
Stores auth-code records, refresh-token families/tokens, and single-use consent
JTIs — **all secrets stored only as SHA-256 hashes**; there is **no separate grant
table** (prior grants are derived from active refresh-token records — §9.3).
Methods: `saveAuthCode`, `consumeAuthCode`, `saveRefreshToken`, `rotateRefreshToken`,
`revokeRefreshTokenFamily`, `findRefreshToken`, `consumeConsentJti`,
`findGrantedScopes`, `sweepExpired`, `close`. Full shapes in §12.
(`findGrantedScopes` is invoked ONLY in **stored-DCR mode for opaque clients** — per
§17.1.6 decision 3, every scheme-shaped (`https://`/CIMD) client_id stands alone
(`priorScopes = []`) in both modes, because refresh rows carry no registration
provenance. In stateless mode client_ids are ephemeral, so a grant keyed by
`(subject, clientId)` is meaningless; those authorizations stand alone.)

## 6.4 `ClientStore` (stored-DCR mode only — fix #4)
```ts
type ApplicationType = "native" | "web" | "machine";   // "machine" added §17.2

interface ClientSecret {                               // §17.2 machine only
  hash: string;                 // unsalted SHA-256 hex of the secret string
  createdAtEpoch: number;       // UTC seconds
  expiresAtEpoch?: number;      // UTC seconds; undefined = live until rotated
}

interface UserClientRegistration {
  clientId: string;
  redirectUris: string[];        // ≥1, validated via §10
  applicationType: "native" | "web";   // RC item (b)
  issuedAtEpoch: number;
}
interface MachineClientRegistration {
  clientId: string;             // "mcc_<random>" — sub prefix marks machine tokens
  redirectUris: string[];       // always [] — machine clients have no redirect
  applicationType: "machine";
  issuedAtEpoch: number;
  name?: string;                // deployer-supplied display label (unverified)
  allowedScopes: string[];      // ⊆ scopeCatalog, validated at provisioning
  secrets: ClientSecret[];      // ≤ 2 unexpired ("active"); see §17.2 rotation
}
type ClientRegistration = UserClientRegistration | MachineClientRegistration;

interface ClientStore {
  save(client: ClientRegistration): Promise<void>;
  find(clientId: string): Promise<ClientRegistration | null>;
}
```
Required only when `dcr.mode === "stored"`. Reference: in-memory map (Phase 2);
a persisted adapter is deployment-specific. The `applicationType` discriminant
selects the record shape and drives the per-client redirect policy (§10):
`native`/`web` are user clients (§9.2 DCR, §10.2 redirect policy); `machine`
records are provisioned out-of-band (§17.2) and carry `allowedScopes` +
`secrets` instead of redirect URIs. The discriminated union is the typed write
contract: it prevents typed in-process callers from constructing a machine
record whose `allowedScopes` or `secrets` are optional. It does not prove the
shape of runtime data returned by a custom or persisted store.

`ClientStore.find` is also a runtime boundary: a persisted or migrated row is
not trusted merely because the port has a TypeScript return type.
`parseMachineClientRegistration(value, expectedClientId, nowEpoch)` accepts a
stored machine row only when its embedded `clientId` is the requested `mcc_` key,
`redirectUris` is empty, `applicationType` is `"machine"`, `issuedAtEpoch` is a
non-negative safe integer, optional `name` is non-empty, `allowedScopes` is a
non-empty array of scope tokens, and `secrets` is the §17.2 shape: lowercase
SHA-256 hashes, non-negative safe-integer timestamps, at most one slot without
an expiry, and at most two active slots (`expiresAtEpoch` absent or
`expiresAtEpoch > nowEpoch`). Structurally valid expired history is accepted;
rotation drops it rather than making an otherwise valid migrated row
unreadable. The parser returns a fresh snapshot containing only those known
fields. Secret verification, rotation, and both reads in the
`client_credentials` grant use that parser with the current clock epoch; a
malformed, over-active, or key-mismatched row fails closed before a secret is
accepted, a record is saved, or a token is minted. The parser deliberately does
not re-check the stored ceiling against the current catalog: catalog narrowing
is enforced when resolving the grant (§17.2), so a still-valid subset remains
usable.

## 6.5 `IdentityPort` (boundary defined at Phase 2; Cloudflare Access + Entra implementations shipped at Phase 3)
Resolves a **verified subject** from an inbound authorize request. The core's
`authorize` use-case takes a required `subject: string`; the adapter/composition
root calls an `IdentityPort` to obtain it (or fails closed). Implementations:
- **CloudflareAccessIdentity** — verifies `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` (RS256 against
  CF JWKS, aud/iss checked), subject = the token's `sub` (a stable CF identity id; `email` the fallback — opaque-`sub`-first, matching the Entra `oid`-first sibling; CF carries the email in a separate claim, so do not key on email).
- **EntraIdentity** — upstream OIDC auth-code+PKCE against Entra v2.0; ONE app
  registration for the bridge; validate iss/aud/tid; map oid/email → subject. The
  bridge then issues its OWN audience-bound tokens (no passthrough).

`GenericOidcIdentity` and the Google preset ship as `RedirectIdentityPort`s
(S4a); the dedicated GitHub port and the console-pairing port are covered in
§17.5–§17.6 (console-pairing shipped S1b; GitHub still locked). The
**upstream redirect-leg orchestrator** (`RedirectIdentityPort` +
`createUpstreamRedirectFlow` — the mounted browser-redirect flow the Entra
primitives currently leave to the host) is locked in **§17.11**.
Cloudflare Access and Entra's concrete shapes were fixed in Phase 3; the
boundary itself was stated at Phase 2 so the core never depends on a specific
IdP. The v0.2 group-authorization extension (`IdentityClaims.allowedScopes`
scope ceiling) is locked in §17.4.

**Identity-port hardening (addenda 11–12, binding on the Phase 3 implementations):**
- **Trust roots MUST be `https`.** A port's JWKS certs URL and issuer MUST be
  `https://` — http JWKS lets a MITM substitute signing keys = total auth bypass.
  Validate with a **raw `^https://` prefix check BEFORE `new URL()`** (Node's lenient
  URL parser normalizes `https:/host` into a valid-looking URL). Applies to
  CloudflareAccessIdentity and EntraIdentity.
- **Required construction config MUST be non-empty.** A blank required field —
  CloudflareAccess `audience`, Entra `tenantId`/`clientId`, generic-OIDC
  `clientId`/`issuer`/`redirectUri` — fails closed at construction (empty ==
  missing config). A blank value would otherwise build a malformed URL or make the
  `aud` check vacuous instead of raising a clear boot error.
- **Optional subject allowlist (defense-in-depth).** A port MAY accept a
  case-insensitive, trimmed subject/email allowlist; empty ⇒ delegate entirely to
  the IdP's own policy (e.g. Cloudflare Access Zero Trust). Never the sole gate.
- **Unit-testable claim validation.** Export the claim-validation logic as a pure
  function so it is unit-testable WITHOUT the JWKS network fetch.
- **Entra multi-tenant.** When `allowedTenantIds` is set, `tid` must be allowlisted
  AND `iss` must equal `entraIssuer(payload.tid)` (the standard Entra multi-tenant
  issuer pattern). Unset ⇒ single-tenant: `iss` must equal `entraIssuer(config.tenantId)`.
- **Entra nonce.** Pass a `nonce` in `getAuthorizationUrl` and validate `payload.nonce`
  on return (OIDC request binding) — recommended. The §17.11 redirect orchestrator
  always does this (orchestrator-minted CSPRNG nonce, threat-model row 31).
  **Header-driven mode (`identityHeader`) residual:** when a fronting proxy
  delivers a raw Entra id_token in a header, mcp-sso never minted the nonce, so
  the port's verifying wrapper (`createEntraIdentity().verify` /
  `verifyEntraIdToken` — jose `jwtVerify` enforces the RS256 signature and
  expiry, then the pure `validateEntraIdToken` claim checks apply: iss/tid/aud,
  and `nonce` only when an expected value is set) does NOT replay-bind the
  token. `validateEntraIdToken` alone is claim validation on an
  ALREADY-signature-verified payload (exported pure for unit-testability — it
  never checks the signature and only requires `exp` presence); a custom
  `IdentityPort` MUST route raw tokens through the verifying wrapper, never
  the pure validator alone. Replay
  protection for a header-delivered id_token belongs to the fronting proxy —
  deploy header mode only behind a proxy that itself performed the nonce-bound
  code exchange and verified the token before forwarding (Cloudflare Access's
  signed assertion is the model), never behind one that merely relays tokens it
  did not validate. Documented as the row-12 residual in the threat model.
- **Entra subject allowlist.** Matches the immutable `oid` by default; matching the
  mutable preferred_username/email requires `allowMutableClaims` (Microsoft warns
  against using those claims for authorization).

## 6.6 `FetcherPort` (boundary now; CIMD impl v0.2)
```ts
interface FetcherPort { fetch(url: string, init?: FetchInit): Promise<FetchResult>; }
```
Reserved for v0.2 Client ID Metadata Documents. **Any metadata fetch MUST go
through an SSRF-guarded `FetcherPort`.** v0.1 does no outbound fetching; the
boundary exists so v0.2 cannot accidentally add a raw `fetch`. The full
enforcement contract — URL admission, the complete IANA IPv4/IPv6 blocklists,
DNS pinning, redirect refusal, byte/timeout caps, document validation — is
locked in **§17.1**.

## 6.7 `RateLimitPort` *(fix #7)*
```ts
interface RateLimitPort { check(key: string): Promise<boolean>; }
const noopRateLimit: RateLimitPort = { async check(): Promise<boolean> { return true; } };
```
Optional DoS defense for the unauthenticated `/oauth/register` + `/oauth/token`
endpoints (threat-model #8). The adapter calls `check("register:<ip>")` /
`check("token:<ip>")` before the use-case; `false` ⇒ **429 Too Many Requests**.
The default `noopRateLimit` allows everything (rate-limiting is advisory, not a
hard gate). A thrown error is treated as **fail-open** (allow) — a rate-limiter
outage must not lock out all auth; this is defense-in-depth, not a security boundary.
**`req.ip` behind a proxy:** the adapter keys on the framework's `req.ip`, which
behind a reverse proxy/tunnel is the proxy's address, not the client's. The
composition root MUST configure the framework to trust the proxy hop
(`trustProxy`/`trust proxy`) so `req.ip` is the real client — otherwise all proxied
traffic is attributed to one IP and the limiter is ineffective.
**Hono has no framework `req.ip`:** the hono adapter takes an explicit
`clientIp?: (c: Context) => string | undefined` option and NEVER reads
`X-Forwarded-For` (or any other client-supplied header) on its own — an
attacker-controlled header must not select the rate-limit bucket
(bucket-per-request = limiter bypass) or forge the audit `ip`. Without
`clientIp`, requests carry no IP: the limiter keys everything into the one
shared `unknown` bucket (collectively throttled, never bypassable) and audit
events omit `ip`. A deployer behind a trusted proxy supplies an extractor
wired to their actual topology (e.g. the rightmost trusted `X-Forwarded-For`
hop, or the runtime's connection info).
